                          The number of created Software RAID devices must be 1 or

                          be a RAID-1. If there are two, the first one has to be a
                          RAID-1, while the RAID level for the second one can be 0,
                          1, or 1+0. As the first RAID device will be the deployment
                          device, enforcing a RAID-1 reduces the risk of ending up
                          with a non-booting node in case of a disk failure. Software
                          RAID will always be deleted.
