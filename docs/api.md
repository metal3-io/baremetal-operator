# API and Resource Definitions

## BareMetalHost

**MetalÂ³** introduces the concept of **BareMetalHost** resource, which
defines a physical host and its properties. The **BareMetalHost** embeds
two well differentiated sections, the bare metal host specification
and its current status.

### BareMetalHost spec

The *BareMetalHost's* *spec* defines the desire state of the host. It contains
mainly, but not only, provisioning details.

#### bmc

The `bmc` fields contain the connection information for the BMC
(Baseboard Management Controller) on the host.

The sub-fields are

* *address* -- The URL for communicating with the BMC controller, based
  on the provider being used. See below for more details.
* *credentialsName* -- A reference to a *secret* containing the
  username and password for the BMC.
* *disableCertificateVerification* -- A boolean to skip certificate
    validation when true.

BMC URLs vary based on the type of BMC and the protocol used to
communicate with them.

| Technology      | Protocol | Boot method   | Format                                            | Notes                                                                   |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Generic IPMI    | IPMI     | iPXE          | `ipmi://<host>:<port>` or just `<host>:<port>`    | Port is optional, defaults to 623                                       |
| Generic Redfish | Redfish  | iPXE          | `redfish://<host>:<port>/<systemID>`              | System ID is a path like `/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`        |

All protocols based on HTTPS (i.e. not IPMI) with an exception of iRMC allow
optionally specifying the carrier protocol in the form of `+http` or `+https`,
for example: `redfish+http://...` or `idrac-virtualmedia+https`. iLO (both
versions) only support HTTPS. When not specified, HTTPS is used by default.

#### online

A boolean indicating whether the host should be powered on (true) or
off (false). Changing this value will trigger a change in power state
on the physical host.

#### bootMACAddress

The MAC address of the NIC used for provisioning the host.

#### bootMode

The boot mode of the host, defaults to `UEFI`, can also be set
to `legacy` for BIOS boot, or `UEFISecureBoot`.

#### consumerRef

A reference to another resource that is using the host, it could be
empty if the host is not being currently used.  For example, a
*Machine* resource when the host is being used by the
[*machine-api*](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api).

#### externallyProvisioned

A boolean indicating whether the host provisioning and deprovisioning
are managed externally. When set:

* Power status can still be managed using the `online` field.
* Hardware inventory will be monitored, but no provisioning or deprovisioning
  operations are performed on the host.

#### image

Holds details for the image to be deployed on a given host.

The sub-fields are

* *url* -- The URL of an image to deploy to the host.
* *checksum* -- The actual checksum or a URL to a file containing
  the checksum for the image at *image.url*.
* *checksumType* -- Checksum algorithms can be specified. Currently
  only `md5`, `sha256`, `sha512` are recognized. If nothing is specified,
  the algorithm is guessed from the checksum length.
* *format* -- This is the disk format of the image. It can be one of `raw`,
  `qcow2`, `vdi`, `vmdk`, `live-iso` or be left unset.
  Setting it to raw enables raw image streaming in Ironic agent for that image.
  Setting it to live-iso enables iso images to live boot without deploying
  to disk, in this case the checksum fields are ignored.

Even though the image sub-fields are required by Ironic,
when the host provisioning is managed externally via `externallyProvisioned: true`,
and power control isn't needed, the fields can be left empty.

#### userData

A reference to the Secret containing the cloudinit user data and its
namespace, so it can be attached to the host before it boots for
configuring different aspects of the OS (like networking, storage,
...).

#### networkData

A reference to the Secret containing the network configuration data
(e.g. network\_data.json) and its namespace, so it can be attached to
the host before it boots to set network up

#### description

A human-provided string to help identify the host.

#### hardwareProfile

**This field is deprecated. See rootDeviceHints instead.**

The name of the hardware profile to use. The following are the current
supported `hardwareProfile` settings and their corresponding root
devices.

| **hardwareProfile** | **Root Device** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `unknown`           | /dev/sda        |
| `libvirt`           | /dev/vda        |
| `dell`              | HCTL: 0:0:0:0   |
| `dell-raid`         | HCTL: 0:2:0:0   |
| `openstack`         | /dev/vdb        |

**NOTE:** These are subject to change.

#### raid

This field contains the information about the RAID configuration for bare
metal servers.

The sub-fields are:

* *hardwareRAIDVolumes* -- It contains the list of logical disks for hardware
   RAID. If rootDeviceHints isn't used, the first volume is the root volume.
   Furthermore, it defines the desired configuration of volume in hardware RAID.
   * *level* -- RAID level for the logical disk. The following levels are
     supported: `0`,`1`,`2`,`5`,`6`,`1+0`,`5+0`,`6+0`.
   * *name* -- Name of the volume. Should be unique within the server. If not
     specified, volume name will be auto-generated.
   * *numberOfPhysicalDisks* -- Integer, number of physical disks to use for the
     logical disk. Defaults to minimum number of disks required for the
     particular RAID level.
   * *physicalDisks* -- List of names of physical disks (Strings). This is an
     optional field. If specified, the `controller` field must be specified too.
   * *controller* -- String, Name of the RAID controller to be used in the
      hardware RAID volume. Optional field.
   * *rotational* -- If true, select only rotational disks, if false - only
     solid-state and NVMe. Any disk types are used by default.
   * *sizeGibibytes* -- Size (Integer) of the logical disk to be created in GiB.
     If unspecified or set to 0, the maximum capacity of disk will be used for
     logical disk.
* *softwareRAIDVolumes* -- It contains the list of logical disks for software
   RAID. If rootDeviceHints isn't used, the first volume is the root volume. If
   HardwareRAIDVolumes is set this item will be invalid. The number of created
   Software RAID devices must be 1 or 2. If there is only one Software RAID
   device, it has to be a RAID-1. If there are two, the first one has to be a
   RAID-1, while the RAID level for the second one can be 0, 1, or 1+0. As the
   first RAID device will be the deployment device, enforcing a RAID-1 reduces
   the risk of ending up with a non-booting node in case of a disk failure.
   Furthermore, SoftwareRAIDVolume defines the desired configuration of volume
   in software RAID.
   * *level* -- RAID level for the logical disk. The following levels are
     supported: `0`,`1`,`1+0`.
   * *physicalDisks* -- A list of device hints, the number of items should be
     greater than or equal to 2.
   * *sizeGibibytes* -- Size (Integer) of the logical disk to be created in
     GiB. If unspecified or set to 0, the maximum capacity of disk will be
     used for logical disk.

If you do not set the RAID field, we will keep the current RAID configuration.

You can set the `hardwareRAIDVolume` as an empty slice to clear the hardware
RAID configuration, for example:

```yaml
spec:
   raid:
     hardwareRAIDVolume: []
```

**NOTE:** Currently the 'raid' field is only supported by ilo5/idrac/irmc.

**NOTE:** Do not try to simultaneously delete hardware RAID volumes and add
software RAID volumes. Delete hardware RAID first, wait for the host to settle
down, add software volumes afterwards.

**NOTE:** If you got following error message:

1. raid settings are defined, but the node's driver %s does not support RAID.
2. node's driver %s does not support hardware RAID.

You can solve it by:

1. Keep raid field is nil.
2. Keep hardwareRAIDVolumes field is nil.

If the error message you get isn't included the above, you may need to check
whether the BM has a RAID controller and keep the raid field blank.

#### firmware

This field contains the information about the BIOS configuration for bare
metal servers.

The sub-fields are:

* *simultaneousMultithreadingEnabled* -- Allows a single physical processor
  core to appear as several logical processors. This supports following
  options: true, false.
* *sriovEnabled* -- SR-IOV support enables a hypervisor to create virtual
  instances of a PCI-express device, potentially increasing performance.
  This supports following options: true, false.
* *virtualizationEnabled* -- Supports the virtualization of platform
  hardware. This supports following options: true, false.

**NOTE:** Currently the `firmware` field is only supported by ilo4/ilo5/irmc
/idrac.

#### rootDeviceHints

Guidance for how to choose the device to receive the image being
provisioned. The storage devices are examined in the order they are
discovered during inspection and the hint values are compared to the
inspected values. The first discovered device that matches is
used. Hints can be combined, and if multiple hints are provided then a
device must match all hints in order to be selected.

The sub-fields are

* *deviceName* -- A string containing a Linux device name like
  `/dev/vda`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
* *hctl* -- A string containing a SCSI bus address like
  `0:0:0:0`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
* *model* -- A string containing a vendor-specific device
  identifier. The hint can be a substring of the actual value.
* *vendor* -- A string containing the name of the vendor or
  manufacturer of the device. The hint can be a substring of the
  actual value.
* *serialNumber* -- A string contianing the device serial
  number. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
* *minSizeGigabytes* -- An integer representing the minimum size of the
  device in Gigabytes.
* *wwn* -- A string containing the unique storage identifier. The
  hint must match the actual value exactly.
* *wwnWithExtension* -- A string containing the unique storage
  identifier with the vendor extension appended. The hint must match
  the actual value exactly.
* *wwnVendorExtension* -- A string containing the unique vendor
  storage indentifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
* *rotational* -- A boolean indicating whether the device should be
  a rotating disk (`true`) or not (`false`).

#### automatedCleaningMode

An interface to enable/disable automated cleaning during provisioning
and deprovisioning. When set to `disabled`, automated cleaning will be
skipped, where `metadata`(default value) enables it.

#### customDeploy

An advanced alternative to using [image](#image). Set the subfield `method`
to the name of a custom deploy step that is provided by your deployment
ramdisk. Most users will want to use [image](#image) instead.

NOTE: setting either `customDeploy.method` or `image.url` triggers provisioning
of the host.

### BareMetalHost status

Moving onto the next block, the *BareMetalHost's* *status* which represents
the host's current state. Including tested credentials, current hardware
details, etc.

#### goodCredentials

A reference to the secret and its namespace holding the last set of
BMC credentials the system was able to validate as working.

#### triedCredentials

A reference to the secret and its namespace holding the last set of
BMC credentials that were sent to the provisioning backend.

#### lastUpdated

The timestamp of the last time the status of the host was updated.

#### operationalStatus

The status of the server. Value is one of the following:

* *OK* -- Indicates all the details for the host are known and working,
  meaning the host is correctly configured and manageable.
* *discovered* -- Implies some of the host's details are either
  not working correctly or missing. For example, the BMC address is known
  but the login credentials are not.
* *error* -- Indicates the system found some sort of irrecuperable error.
  Refer to the *errorMessage* field in the status section for more details.

#### errorMessage

Details of the last error reported by the provisioning backend, if
any.

#### hardware

The details for hardware capabilities discovered on the host. These
are filled in by the provisioning agent when the host is registered.

The sub-fields are

* *nics* -- List of network interfaces for the host.
   * *name* -- A string identifying the network device,
     e.g. *nic-1*.
   * *mac* -- The MAC address of the NIC.
   * *ip* -- The IP address of the NIC, if one was assigned
     when the discovery agent ran.
   * *speedGbps* -- The speed of the device in Gbps.
   * *vlans* -- A list holding all the VLANs available for this NIC.

#### hardwareProfile (status)

**This field is deprecated. See rootDeviceHints instead.**

The name of the hardware profile that matches the hardware discovered
on the host based on the details saved to the *Hardware* section. If
the hardware does not match any known profile, the value `unknown`
will be set on this field and is used by default. In practice, this
only affects which device the OS image will be written to. The
following are the current supported `hardwareProfile` settings and
their corresponding root devices.

| **hardwareProfile** | **Root Device** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `unknown`           | /dev/sda        |
| `libvirt`           | /dev/vda        |

**NOTE:** These are subject to change.

#### poweredOn

Boolean indicating whether the host is powered on.

See *online* on the *BareMetalHost's* *Spec*.

#### provisioning

Settings related to deploying an image to the host.

* *state* -- The current state of any ongoing provisioning operation.
   The following are the currently supported ones:
   * *\<empty string\>* -- There is no provisioning happening, at the moment.
   * *unmanaged* -- There is an insufficient information available to register
     the host.
   * *registering* -- The host's BMC details are being checked.
   * *match profile* -- The discovered hardware details on the host
     are being compared against known profiles.
   * *available* -- The host is available to be consumed. (This state was
     previously known as *ready*.)
   * *preparing* -- The existing configuration will be removed, and the new
     configuration will be set on the host.
   * *provisioning* -- An image is being written to the host's disk(s).
   * *provisioned* -- An image has been completely written to the host's
     disk(s).
   * *externally provisioned* -- MetalÂ³ does not manage the image on the host.
   * *deprovisioning* -- The image is being wiped from the host's disk(s).

```

And here is the secret `bmo-controlplane-0-bmc-secret` holding the host's
BMC credentials, base64 encoded:

```console
$echo -n 'admin' | base64

YWRtaW4=

$echo -n 'password' | base64

cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

Copy the above base64 encoded username and password pair and
paste it into the yaml as mentioned below.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bmo-controlplane-0-bmc-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

NOTE: After decoding the secret content, whitespace is stripped from
the beginning and end before the username and password values are
used.

## Triggering Provisioning

Several conditions must be met in order to initiate provisioning.

1. The host `spec.image.url` field must contain a URL for a valid
   image file that is visible from within the cluster and from the
   host receiving the image.
2. The host must have `online` set to `true` so that the operator will
   keep the host powered on.
3. The host must have all of the BMC details.

To initiate deprovisioning, clear the image URL from the host spec.

## Unmanaged Hosts

Hosts created without BMC details will be left in the `unmanaged`
state until the details are provided. Unmanaged hosts cannot be
provisioned and their power state is undefined.

## Pausing reconciliation

It is possible to pause the reconciliation of a BareMetalHost object by adding
an annotation `baremetalhost.metal3.io/paused`. **MetalÂ³**  provider sets the
value of this annotation as `metal3.io/capm3` when the cluster to which the
**BareMetalHost** belongs, is paused and removes it when the cluster is
not paused. If you want to pause the reconciliation of **BareMetalHost** you can
put any value on this annotation **other than `metal3.io/capm3`**. Please make
sure that you remove the annotation  **only if the value of the annotation is
not `metal3.io/capm3`, but another value that you have provided**. Removing the
annotation will enable the reconciliation again.

## Detaching hosts

It is possible to prevent management of a BareMetalHost object by adding
an annotation `baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached`. This removes the host from
the provisioner, which prevents any management of the physical host (e.g
changing power state, or deprovisioning), but still allows the BMH status
to be updated unlike the `paused` annotation. While in this state the
OperationalStatus field will be `detached` but the provisioning state will
be unmodified.  This API only has any effect for BareMetalHost resources
that are in either `Provisioned`, `ExternallyProvisioned` or `Ready`/`Available`
state.

Please note only the existence of the annotation is important to treat the BMH
as detached and the value of the annotation is always ignored.

## HostFirmwareSettings

A **HostFirmwareSettings** resource is used to manage BIOS settings for a host,
there is a one-to-one mapping with **BareMetalHosts**.  A
**HostFirmwareSettings** resource is created when BIOS settings are read from
Ironic as the host moves to the Ready state.  These settings are the complete
actual BIOS configuration names returned from the BMC, typically 100-200
settings per host, as compared to the three vendor-independent fields stored in
the **BareMetalHosts** `firmware` field.

### HostFirmwareSettings spec

The *HostFirmwareSettings's* *spec* defines the desired BIOS settings. These
settings will be sent to Ironic as part of clean-steps for update to the BMC
when the host goes through cleaning, i.e. when the **BareMetalHosts** go
through the Preparing state.

#### spec settings

The `settings` are an array of name/value pairs for the BIOS settings.
The names must match the names read from Ironic and stored in the `status`
field. The values must be within the limits as defined in the *FirmwareSchema*.
Only settings which are not defined as `ReadOnly` or `Unique` (such as
SerialNumbers) will be accepted.

### HostFirmwareSettings status

The *HostFirmwareSettings's* *status* defines the actual BIOS settings read
from Ironic.

#### status schema

`Schema` is a reference to a *FirmwareSchema* resource that describes each
BIOS setting by type and configurable limits for the type.

#### status settings

The `settings` are an array of name/value pairs listing the complete set
of BIOS settings retrieved from Ironic.

#### status conditions

`conditions` reflects the status of the fields in the *spec*. Possible
conditions are:

* *Valid* -- When set to *True* indicates that all *settings* in the *spec* are
  correct for names and values. This is also set to *True* when nothing is set
  in the *spec*. When set to *False* indicates that one or more names or values
  in the *spec* are incorrect, the actual error will be shown in the *Events*
  field.
* *ChangeDetected* -- Indicates whether or not settings in the *spec* are
  different than settings in the *status*. When set to *True* the settings that
  are different will be included in the clean-steps that are written to Ironic
  as part of cleaning.

### HostFirmwareSettings Example

The following is a complete example from a running cluster of a
*HostFirmwareSettings* resource (in YAML), it includes its spec and status
sections:

```yaml

    SerialNumber: QPX12345
```

## FirmwareSchema

A **FirmwareSchema** resource contains the limits each setting, specific to
each host.  This data comes directly from the BMC via Ironic. It can be used
to prevent misconfiguration of the **HostFirmwareSettings** *spec* field so
that invalid values are not sent to the host. The **FirmwareSchema** has a
unique identifier derived from its settings and limits. Multiple hosts may therefore
have the same **FirmwareSchema** identifier so its likely that more than one
**HostFirmwareSettings** reference the same **FirmwareSchema** when
hardware of the same vendor and model are used.

### FirmwareSchema spec

#### spec schema

A map of settings names and limits. The values returned in the limits depend
on the type of the setting. The following fields are included:

* *attribute_type* -- The type of setting - `Enumeration`, `Integer`, `String`,
  `Boolean`, or `Password`
* *allowable_values* -- A list of allowable values when the `attribute_type` is `Enumeration`
* *lower_bound* -- The lowest allowed value when attribute_type is `Integer`
* *upper_bound* -- The highest allowed value when attribute_type is `Integer`
* *min_length* -- The shortest string length that the value can have when
  attribute_type is `String`
* *max_length* -- The longest string length that the value can have when
  attribute_type is `String`
* *read_only* -- The setting is ready only and cannot be modified
* *unique* -- The setting is specific to this host

#### hardwareVendor

The name of the vendor that this schema corresponds to.

#### hardwareModel

The hardware model that this schema corresponds to.

## HardwareData

A **HardwareData** resource contains hardware specifications data of a specific host
and it is tightly coupled to its owner resource BareMetalHost. The data in the HardwareData
comes from Ironic after a successful inspection phase. As such, operator will create HardwareData
resource for a specific BareMetalHost during transitioning phase from inspecting into available
state of the BareMetalHost. HardwareData gets deleted automatically by the operator whenever its
BareMetalHost is deleted. Deprovisioning of the BareMetalHost should not trigger the deletion of
HardwareData, but during next provisioning it can be re-created (with the same name and namespace)
with the latest inspection data retrieved from Ironic. HardwareData holds the same name and namespace
as its corresponding BareMetalHost resource. Currently, HardwareData doesn't have *Status* subresource
but only the *Spec*, which we cover next.

### HardwareData spec

As you probably already noticed, the *Spec* of HardwareData is the same as [.Status.hardware](#hardware)
of the BareMetalHost. However, this behaviour is temporary and eventually we will drop
[.Status.hardware](#hardware) from BareMetalHost and only rely on HardwareData *Spec*. The reason
for having duplication of inspection data at the  moment is to avoid breaking the existing deployments.

## PreprovisioningImage

A **PreprovisioningImage** resource is automatically created by baremetal-operator for each BareMetalHost
to ensure creation of a *preprovisioning image* for it. In this context, a preprovisioning image
is an ISO or initramfs file that contains the [Ironic agent](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-python-agent/).
The relevant parts of BareMetalHost are copied to the PreprovisioningImage *Spec*,
the resulting image is expected to appear in the *Status*.

The baremetal-operator project contains a simple controller for PreprovisioningImages
that uses images provided in the environment variables `DEPLOY_ISO_URL` and `DEPLOY_RAMDISK_URL`.
More sophisticated controllers may be written downstream (for example, the OpenShift
[image-customization-controller](https://github.com/openshift/image-customization-controller)).

### PreprovisioningImage spec

The PreprovisioningImage's spec provides input for the image building process.

* `acceptFormats`: a list of accepted image formats: `iso` or `initrd`.

* `architecture`: the CPU architecture to build the image for, e.g. `x86_64`.
  The default PreprovisioningImage controller does not use this field.

* `networkData`: the name of a *Secret* with the network configuration for the image.
  The default PreprovisioningImage controller does not use this field.

### PreprovisioningImage status

The PreprovisioningImage's status provides information about the resulting image.

* `architecture`: the CPU architecture of the image, e.g. `x86_64`.

* `extraKernelParams`: additional kernel parameters that baremetal-operator will add to the node
  when PXE booting the initramfs image. Has no meaning for ISO images.

* `format`: format of the image: `iso` or `initrd`. Must be one of the formats provided in `acceptFormats`.

* `imageUrl`: the URL of the resulting image.

* `kernelUrl`: the URL of the kernel to use together with the initramfs image. If not provided,
  baremetal-operator uses the default kernel image from the environment variables.
  Has no meaning for ISO images.

* `networkData`: the name of a *Secret* with the network configuration of the image.
