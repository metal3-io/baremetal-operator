# API and Resource Definitions

## BareMetalHost

**Metal³** introduces the concept of **BareMetalHost** resource, which
defines a physical host and its properties. The **BareMetalHost** embeds
two well differentiated sections, the bare metal host specification
and its current status.

### Pausing reconciliation

It is possible to pause the reconciliation of a BareMetalHost object by adding
an annotation `baremetalhost.metal3.io/paused`. **Metal³**  provider sets the
value of this annotation as `metal3.io/capm3` when the cluster to which the
**BareMetalHost** belongs, is paused and removes it when the cluster is
not paused. If you want to pause the reconciliation of **BareMetalHost** you can
put any value on this annotation **other than `metal3.io/capm3`**. Please make
sure that you remove the annotation  **only if the value of the annotation is
not `metal3.io/capm3`, but another value that you have provided**. Removing the
annotation will enable the reconciliation again.

### BareMetalHost spec

The *BareMetalHost's* *spec* defines the desire state of the host. It contains
mainly, but not only, provisioning details.

#### Spec fields

* *bmc* -- The connection information for the BMC (Baseboard Management
  Controller) on the host.
  * *address* -- The URL for communicating with the BMC controller, based
    on the provider being used, the URL will look as follows:
    * IPMI
      * `ipmi://<host>:<port>`, an unadorned `<host>:<port>` is also accepted
        and the port is optional, if using the default one (623).
    * Dell iDRAC
      * `idrac://` (or `idrac+http://` to disable TLS).
      * `idrac-virtualmedia://` to use virtual media instead of PXE
        for attaching the provisioning image to the host.
    * Fujitsu iRMC
      * `irmc://<host>:<port>`, where `<port>` is optional if using the default.
    * HUAWEI ibmc
      * `ibmc://<host>:<port>` (or `ibmc+http://<host>:<port>` to disable TLS)
    * iLO 5 Redfish
      * `ilo5-redfish://` (or `ilo5-redfish+http://` to disable TLS), the hostname
        or IP address, and the path to the system ID are required,
        for example `ilo5-redfish://myhost.example/redfish/v1/Systems/MySystemExample`
    * Redfish
      * `redfish://` (or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS)
      * `redfish-virtualmedia://` to use virtual media instead of PXE
        for attaching the provisioning image to the host.
      * The hostname or IP address, and the path to the system ID are
        required for all variants.  For example
        `redfish://myhost.example/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
        or `redfish://myhost.example/redfish/v1/Systems/1`

  * *credentialsName* -- A reference to a *secret* containing the
    username and password for the BMC.

  * *disableCertificateVerification* -- A boolean to skip certificate
    validation when true.

* *online* -- A boolean indicating whether the host should be powered on
  (true) or off (false). Changing this value will trigger a change in
  power state on the physical host.

* *consumerRef* -- A reference to another resource that is using the
  host, it could be empty if the host is not being currently used.
  For example, a *Machine* resource when the host is being used by the
  [*machine-api*](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api).

* *externallyProvisioned* -- A boolean indicating whether the host
  provisioning and deprovisioning are managed externally. When set,
  the host's power status and hardware inventory will be monitored
  but no provisioning or deprovisioning operations are performed
  on the host.

* *image* -- Holds details for the image to be deployed on a given host.
  * *url* -- The URL of an image to deploy to the host.
  * *checksum* -- The actual checksum or a URL to a file containing
    the checksum for the image at *image.url*.
  * *checksumType* -- Checksum algorithms can be specified. Currently
    only `md5`, `sha256`, `sha512` are recognized. If nothing is specified
    `md5` is assumed.
  * *format* -- This is the disk format of the image. It can be one of `raw`,
    `qcow2`, `vdi`, `vmdk`, or be left unset. Setting it to raw enables raw
    image streaming in Ironic agent for that image.

* *userData* -- A reference to the Secret containing the cloudinit user data
  and its namespace, so it can be attached to the host before it boots
  for configuring different aspects of the OS (like networking, storage, ...).

* *networkData* -- A reference to the Secret containing the network
  configuration data (e.g. network\_data.json) and its namespace, so it can be
  attached to the host before it boots to set network up

* *description* -- A human-provided string to help identify the host.

* *hardwareProfile* -- **This field is deprecated. See rootDeviceHints instead.**
  The name of the hardware profile to use. The following are the current
  supported `hardwareProfile` settings and their corresponding root devices.

  | **hardwareProfile** | **Root Device** |

  **NOTE:** These are subject to change.

* *rootDeviceHints* -- Guidance for how to choose the device to
  receive the image being provisioned. The storage devices are
  examined in the order they are discovered during inspection and the
  hint values are compared to the inspected values. The first
  discovered device that matches is used. Hints can be combined, and
  if multiple hints are provided then a device must match all hints in
  order to be selected.
  * *deviceName* -- A string containing a Linux device name like
    `/dev/vda`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
  * *hctl* -- A string containing a SCSI bus address like
    `0:0:0:0`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
  * *model* -- A string containing a vendor-specific device
    identifier. The hint can be a substring of the actual value.
  * *vendor* -- A string containing the name of the vendor or
    manufacturer of the device. The hint can be a substring of the
    actual value.
  * *serialNumber* -- A string contianing the device serial
    number. The hint must match the actual value exactly.
  * *minSizeGigabytes* -- An integer representing the minimum size of the
    device in Gigabytes.
  * *wwn* -- A string containing the unique storage identifier. The

And here is the secret `bmo-master-0-bmc-secret` holding the host's
BMC credentials, base64 encoded:

```console
$echo -n 'admin' | base64

YWRtaW4=

$echo -n 'password' | base64

cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

Copy the above base64 encoded username and password pair and
paste it into the yaml as mentioned below.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bmo-master-0-bmc-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

## Triggering Provisioning

Several conditions must be met in order to initiate provisioning.

1. The host `spec.image.url` field must contain a URL for a valid
   image file that is visible from within the cluster and from the
   host receiving the image.
2. The host must have `online` set to `true` so that the operator will
   keep the host powered on.
3. The host must have all of the BMC details.

To initiate deprovisioning, clear the image URL from the host spec.

## Unmanaged Hosts

Hosts created without BMC details will be left in the `unmanaged`
state until the details are provided. Unmanaged hosts cannot be
provisioned and their power state is undefined.
